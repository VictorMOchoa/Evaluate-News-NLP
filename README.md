# Evaluating a news article using NLP

## Synopsis
This is the fourth project in Udacity's Front-End Nanodegree. For this project, we were given a skeleton project from which we were to build a simple webapp where the user is to input a valid URL into an input box and once clicking submit, we are to make an API call to Aylien's NLP text-analysis API to determine the sentiment of the text found in the article. Once the response was received, we were to post the results to the webpage. In addition to developing this, we were also asked to build a prod version of this project as well as include some JEST tests for the js files we included in the project.
